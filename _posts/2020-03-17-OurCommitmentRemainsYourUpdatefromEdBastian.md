Dear Bert,

We are in unprecedented times. With the ongoing spread of COVID-19
(coronavirus) and the incredible speed at which things are changing around
us, we are continually adapting our operations and business. With recent
reductions

in our flight schedule, I personally want to ensure that every member of
our Delta family is informed on an ongoing basis, including you.

As an airline, we have faced many challenges and each has made us better
prepared for a situation like this. Caring for you continues to be our top
priority, and our people are working tirelessly across the globe, taking
every precaution to make sure that when you are ready to travel, Delta is
here for you.

We are working around the clock to:

   - *Protect you and your loved ones when you fly. *You have my promise
   that our team is going above and beyond the guidance of the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to ensure
   your safety. We are building on an ever-present focus on cleanliness and
   continually assessing ways to enhance your safety throughout the travel
   experience. This includes disinfecting check-in kiosks regularly, more
   frequently cleaning and disinfecting gate areas, and doubling down on our
   regular aircraft cleaning. We’ve added a fogging process to disinfect most
   transoceanic flights and are quickly securing more equipment to expand
   fogging to even more flights. As always, in-flight air is filtered through
   Delta’s state-of-the-art circulation system with HEPA filtration. Here
   
   is a comprehensive look at the work we are doing to protect you.


   - *Make it easier to adjust travel plans.* We know customers trying to
   contact us are experiencing extremely long wait times, and we are
   continuing to do everything possible to address your needs as we work
   through a solution. Our teams are currently focused on helping customers
   whose travel is scheduled within the next 72 hours. If your travel is
   further out, you may cancel or change your flight anytime before your
   travel date using My Trips on Delta.com.
   
   To allow even more flexibility, any Delta ticket expiring in March or April
   is being extended to enable rebooking and travel until Dec. 31, 2020.
   Whenever your travel may be, rest assured that all changes will be
   processed and applicable credits will be issued; if you don’t take your
   flight, your ticket number automatically becomes an unused eCredit within
   24 hours. We promise to resolve your issues and sincerely appreciate your
   patience.


   - *Address your SkyMiles® Medallion® Status questions.* We’re grateful
   for the loyalty of millions of customers who choose to fly with Delta each
   year, and I know some of you have questions regarding Medallion® Status
   and promotions. Please know that we hear you and understand your concerns.
   Right now, we are 100 percent focused on helping our customers with
   immediate flight needs. As soon as we get through this critical time, we
   will address questions about what we are doing to help ensure you can
   continue to enjoy Status and benefits when you fly now, and in the future.

While we are reducing our flight schedule, we know the ability to travel
remains essential. Many of you have reached out to us to express your
support for our people – it means so much to me and our Delta family, and I
thank you deeply for your care.

I want to reiterate my commitment, and that of the world’s best airline
professionals, to safely connect you to the places and people who mean the
most to you. We appreciate your loyalty and never take it for granted.

Sincerely,



*Ed Bastian*
CEO
