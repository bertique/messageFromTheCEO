  An important message from our CEO
  Dear Bert,
As a valued member of our IHG® Rewards Club family, we appreciate your
loyalty and the trust you place in us as a travel partner. Recognizing the
ongoing and increased uncertainty that coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing
around the world, our highest priority is the health and well-being of our
guests and employees. With that in mind, we wanted to update you on the
actions we have taken in response to the outbreak.

*Supporting your plans*
We know that flexibility is what our guests are looking for right now. So,
we are * waiving cancellation fees* for existing and new bookings at * all
IHG hotels globally* for *stays between March 9, 2020 and April 30, 2020.*

We continue to monitor the situation and will be keeping this policy under
review. *Please visit our website

for more information on our latest cancellation policy and additional
updates* – including specific information on bookings made through a travel
agent or online booking platform (e.g. Booking com, Expedia) and Groups &
Meetings bookings.

For bookings beyond April 30, 2020 we want to remind you of the flexibility
already built into our rates and packages that allow our guests to amend
travel plans as necessary. Our Best Flexible Rate allows our guests to
change or cancel their reservation one to two days prior to arrival.
Changing the date on any reservations may result in different pricing, but
there is no fee for making changes. To ask about any booking, contact the
hotel or our reservation team.


We hope this helps you to plan and book any future travel with confidence.

*During your stay*
Our number one priority is your health, safety and well-being. We are
closely monitoring developments around the world and are in contact with
global organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and relevant authorities
for country-specific requirements, to ensure the actions we take are
comprehensive and suitable.

All of our hotels are required to adhere to comprehensive health and safety
procedures including all local laws. In addition, we provide our hotels
with best practices and guidelines and have supplemented these resources
with additional COVID-19 cleanliness-specific guidance, training and
information consistent with our own high standards.

*IHG Rewards Club status*
We know that many of you are now thinking about how to manage your loyalty
activity this year and we are committed to supporting you to do that. You
are our most loyal guests and we want to give you more reasons to get away
and stay with us – when the time is right for you.

With more constrained travel plans and a shorter time period during which
members can earn Elite tier status, we are *reducing the Elite membership
criteria * required (nights or points) this year by *25% or more.* See
details here.


With this change, you can continue to earn Elite membership status this
year and enjoy all the IHG Rewards Club benefits this brings through 2020
and into 2021. This change will be reflected in member accounts in the
coming weeks.

Our teams pride themselves on providing *True Hospitality for everyone* – a
promise that guides us every day and is fundamental during times like this.

I’d like to thank you for the trust and support you have in us and we look
forward to welcoming you to an IHG hotel soon.

Best wishes,



Keith Barr
Chief Executive Officer
IHG
