Committed to keeping you
connected.


To our customers,

I hope you and your loved ones have remained safe and healthy during this
extraordinary time. We understand how important it is for you to stay
connected and are working hard to continue to serve you, while keeping our
teammates and customers protected. We've made a number of changes to our
operations over the last few weeks as this pandemic has evolved. Here's
what we're doing:

*Supporting our Teammates*

We are doing all we can to support our employees who live and work in the
local communities we serve, including the following:

•
*We have provided call center representatives and other employees with new
work-from-home tools* such as laptops and other equipment so they can
continue to work even when their normal office is temporarily closed. At
this point, over 90% of our call center employees are working from home.

•
*Redeployed and retrained thousands* of retail and direct sales
representatives to allow them to perform other company functions that they
can do safely from home even as their regular jobs are impacted.

•
*Changed work processes and safety protocols* to enable employees whose
jobs are outdoors or in essential network operations centers to continue to
work safely.

•
Across Comcast, NBC Universal and Sky, we have *committed $500 million to
support employees* through continued pay and benefits where operations have
been paused or impacted.


*Meeting Customer Needs*

•
*We continue to focus on network reliability and performance.* Our network
engineers and operations centers continue to work 24/7 to meet shifts in
usage patterns and increased network traffic. You can learn more here

about how our network is performing at this time.

•
*There are new online tools to support you.* We have improved our tools, so
it's faster and easier to get personalized support and manage your account
online. You can learn more about these tools here

and at the end of this email.

•
*Peacock, a new streaming service from NBCUniversal, will be available to
you this month, at no extra cost.* Peacock is coming exclusively to Xfinity
customers, before it debuts more broadly this summer. Peacock will offer
original programming; on-demand libraries of popular TV shows including *30
Rock* and *Parks and Recreation*; favorite films from Hollywood's biggest
studios including *Shrek* and *Meet the Parents*; and other content
including news, sports, late night and reality TV. Peacock Premium will be
available to you at no extra cost, a $4.99 per month value. Learn more here

.

•
*We have made it easier for you to find news and home essentials.* The *Inside
Guide* has launched, where you can see a range of information including
helpful tips on fitness, cooking and more. Say *"Inside Guide"* into your
Xfinity Voice Remote to access it. Say *"Coronavirus"* to stay up to date
with the latest local and global news and information.

•
*New free entertainment is now available for you.* You can enjoy a great
lineup of free entertainment from more than two dozen providers, including
HBO, Epix, kweliTV, Brown Sugar, and Cinelatino. To access free
entertainment, say *"Free"* into your Xfinity Voice Remote.


*Protecting our Employees and Customers*

Thank you for your continued patience as we implement new procedures to
help keep our customers and our teammates safe.

•
*We have changed our retail store opening times and temporarily closed many
stores.* To ensure the health of our teammates and customers, we have
closed many locations, and for those that remain open, we have reduced
their hours of operation. Services offered in-store are currently limited
to equipment exchanges, kiosk bill payments, new Internet equipment pick-up
and mobile device replacement orders for ship to home. Please check online

for hours and status before heading to a store.

•
*Our technicians are following new safety protocols for home visits.*
Xfinity technicians will now drop off equipment, do outside work and
troubleshoot by phone if necessary. They will only enter a customer's home
and repair the primary outlet if service is not working. If technicians
must enter the home, they will follow CDC guidelines and keep at least a
six-foot distance from customers. If unable to maintain social distancing,
they will cover their face with a mask or cloth as required by state or
local law, or if requested by the customer.

We will also continue to do our part for the broader community through our
Internet Essentials program and free use of our WiFi hotspots. For details
on these programs and additional updates on our response to COVID-19,
please visit xfinity.com/prepare

Thank you for continuing to trust Xfinity to keep you connected. I wish the
best to you and your families.
