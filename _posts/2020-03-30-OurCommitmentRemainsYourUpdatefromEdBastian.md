Dear Bert,

Three months ago, I would have never dreamt our world would be facing such
volatile times, but I remain confident we will prevail because of you and
the people of Delta. To support you and our communities, we are carrying
medical supplies globally via cargo flights

and operating repatriation flights to get you and your loved ones home. If
you are a medical volunteer, we are offering free flights

to certain U.S. regions that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19
(coronavirus) to support medical professionals on the front lines. As we
make swift decisions to support your health and safety, we will keep you
continually informed so you can make the best travel decisions for you and
your family.

We remain committed to:

   - *Taking care of you. *Your safety is our primary focus, and we’ve
   elevated our efforts for you during this pandemic. Our new level of Delta
   clean won’t be reserved just for times of crisis – we’re expanding new
   practices to all flights starting April 1. This means you will have fogging
   on domestic aircraft overnight as we have done internationally and
   sanitization of high-touch areas like tray tables, entertainment screens,
   armrests and seat-back pockets via our extensive cleaning checklist on all
   trips. And if a plane doesn’t pass our spot check before you board, our
   teams are empowered to hold the flight and call back the cleaning crew.
   We’re also minimizing touchpoints between you and others by temporarily
   moving to essential food and beverage service
   
   onboard all U.S. domestic and short-haul international flights and at our
   Delta Sky Clubs® as well as evaluating adjustments to long-haul
   international flying. We also understand you have significant life moments
   like graduations and weddings this time of year and many of those plans are
   in flux. As a dad with three grown children and one still in high school, I
   empathize with you. We continue to make it easier to change or cancel your
   flights with no fee via My Trips on Delta.com
   
   .


   - *Taking care of our people. *Our people are the heartbeat of our
   business and the reason so many of you choose to fly with us. Protecting
   their jobs and safety is paramount so they can continue providing you with
   great care. More than 21,000 have volunteered to take short-term, unpaid
   leaves of absence while we operate a reduced schedule. To help supplement
   their income during their leave, we’re partnering with several companies to
   provide temporary job opportunities. Your safety and the safety of our
   employees continues to be our focus as we clean and disinfect surfaces
   across our airports, with extra care for pilots, flight attendants and gate
   agents who interact with you daily. We even use foggers to clean our
   Reservations locations, leveraging the technology we use to keep you safe,
   to keep our employees safe too.


   - *Protecting our future.* The measures we are taking to protect you,
   our people and our company will result in a flying experience that’s
   different from what you typically expect from Delta. We appreciate your
   patience and understanding as these temporary changes to our amenities and
   service are implemented. We are committed to bringing them back as quickly
   as possible when the crisis passes. With reduced flights for the time
   being, we know close-in schedule changes can be challenging. We encourage
   you to download the Fly Delta app
   
   and check your flight status before you leave for the airport and
   appreciate your patience as we navigate this unprecedented time together.

I want to add that we are deeply grateful to members of Congress, the
President and the administration for steps they have taken to provide
emergency relief to airline employees nationwide. This includes payroll
assistance funds to ensure there will be no involuntary furloughs or
reductions in pay rates across our U.S. industry for the next six months,
at which time we hope the virus is contained and your demand for our
services returns.

In the days to come, we will continue to move fast and make decisions that
strengthen our future. If you’re still flying with us, thank you. And if
you’re not back with us yet, we thank you for your continuous support and
look forward to serving you again when the time is right. Please take great
care of yourself and your loved ones – nothing is more important than your
health and safety.


Sincerely,



*Ed Bastian*
CEO
