An Update on How We’re Supporting our Guests and Team, from CEO Brian
Cornell

Every day, for weeks now, you’ve turned to Target to stock up on supplies
as you cope with the impact of the coronavirus. As we all continue to adapt
to the country’s fast-changing needs, we want to make sure we’re doing
everything we can to keep our stores open and support our team.

We've announced a couple of changes that will go into effect today and last
until further notice.

We’ll reduce hours and close all stores by 9 p.m. daily. This will help us
as we replenish and deeply clean our stores for our guests. And it builds
on measures we shared earlier this month
,
including enhanced cleaning and more staffing for in-demand services that
support social distancing, like Order Pickup and Drive Up.

We’ll also reserve the first hour of shopping each Wednesday to support
vulnerable guests, including the elderly and those with underlying health
concerns.

In addition to these changes, we’re fast-tracking the flow of products that
are in highest demand, including food, medicine and other essentials. We’ll
continue to maintain limitations on in-demand items and respectfully ask
all guests to consider their immediate needs and purchase accordingly so
more families can find the products they need.

Taking care of our team

During this challenging time, I can assure you that the Target team is
working hard to be there for you and your families – and we’re doubling
down on everything we can to support them.

We recently announced changes to our back-up care benefit
,
so in the face of school and other care-facility closures, back-up care
will be available to all, including frontline team members who are doing so
much right now. This comes on top of temporarily waiving our absenteeism
policy and covering quarantine and confirmed illness pay. We’ll also
continue to offer benefits like paid family leave and free counseling
services for the range of challenges our team might be facing.

So much of what we’ve seen over the last few weeks has been heroic, from
our dedicated teams working in our stores and supply chain, to the way you
and your families have banded together.

As I’ve said from the outset, a commitment to help all families is at the
heart of Target’s purpose. Our goal is to be here for you and keep
navigating through this uncertainty together – and we will do everything in
our power to live up to that promise.

Chairman and CEO
