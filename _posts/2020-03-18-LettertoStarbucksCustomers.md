        OUR ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY -
NAVIGATING THROUGH COVID-19
[http://f.e.starbucks.com/i/52/163466415/spcr.gif]
[http://f.e.starbucks.com/i/52/163466415/spcr.gif]      The world is grappling with an issue of enormous scale
and human impact, and our hearts go out to all who have
been affected by the outbreak of coronavirus
(COVID-19).

At Starbucks, we believe it is our role and responsibility
during this time to prioritize two things: the health and
well-being of our customers and partners while also
playing a constructive role in supporting local health
officials and government leaders as they work to contain
the virus. Through that lens, we will continue to make
decisions with vigilance and courage informed by the
latest science-based information and guided by Our
Mission and Values.

I wanted to personally reach out to you and provide an
update on the actions that Starbucks is taking to help
prevent the spread of the virus and support the health
and well-being of our customers, our partners
(employees) and our communities.

You may be aware that over the last few weeks we have
taken a series of precautionary steps in response to this
developing public health impact, including increased
cleaning and sanitizing procedures for our stores. We
have also prepared our stores to respond quickly to any
emerging situation, leveraging the considerable insights
we’ve gained from our experience in China, where we
continue to see encouraging signs of recovery with over
90% of stores reopened.

We appreciate your understanding that, as a customer,
your Starbucks Experience may look different as we
navigate through this time together. While we are
currently maintaining regular operations across the U.S.
and Canada, our stores are prepared to modify
operations with options that still allow us to serve you
your favorite beverage and food. This means that as we
navigate this dynamic situation
community-by-community and store-by-store, we may
adapt the store experience by limiting seating to
improve social distancing, enable mobile order-only
scenarios for pickup via the Starbucks App, or in some cases only the Drive Thru will be
open. As a last resort, we will close a store if we feel it is
in the best interest of our customers and partners, or if
we are directed to do so by government authorities. In
any such situation, we expect store disruption to be
temporary.

I want to also thank you for supporting our Starbucks
partners who proudly wear the green apron. We have a
long-standing history of caring for our partners,
recognizing they are the heartbeat of Starbucks. That is
why, as we navigate this dynamic situation, in addition
to our sick leave benefit and mental health offerings, we
are also expanding catastrophe pay so that partners do
not need to feel like they need to choose between their
health and their work.

Thank you for being a loyal customer. It is our intent to
remain transparent, providing the latest information
from Starbucks here.

Starbucks resilience is owed to our unwavering Mission
to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person,
one cup and one neighborhood at a time.

We are privileged to serve you and your community and
look forward to seeing you soon.

Regards,
