Our Continued Efforts: We Will Travel Again
  



Dear ,
It’s been three weeks since I last communicated with you about the dramatic
impact of COVID-19 on our business. Sadly, since that time, we’ve all borne
witness to how this insidious virus is impacting our families, our
communities and our very way of life. What we’re facing is daunting, but I
am heartened by the moments of triumph in everyday acts of courage,
humanity and love. Although these are trying times for us all, I remain
optimistic that our world will thrive once again.

Today, I want to let you know how we’re focused on supporting the
communities where our associates live and work. I also want to provide you
with an update on our room cancellation policy and Marriott Bonvoy status
and points expiration dates.
In the Community
Marriott understands that the pulse of the world beats as one to overcome
COVID-19 and its devastating impact around the globe. As we all watch the
news unfold about this unprecedented event, it’s clear that there is a need
to assist and bolster healthcare workers and community caregivers who are
on the frontlines working to contain this disease. To that end, we have
established the following programs to aid in the urgent fight against the
pandemic.
With support from our credit card partners, American Express and JPMorgan
Chase, Marriott has committed to provide $10 million worth of hotel stays
for healthcare professionals leading the fight against COVID-19 in the
United States. The initiative, called *Rooms for Responders*, will provide
free rooms in some of the areas most impacted including New York City, New
Orleans, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C. and
Newark, N.J. To implement this initiative, we collaborated with the
American College of Emergency Physicians and the Emergency Nurses
Association to match doctors and nurses with free accommodations at
participating hotels.

In a separate effort for frontline healthcare workers, we have joined with
a number of our hotel owners and franchisee partners to launch the *Community
Caregiver Program*
.
This initiative, available in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and
Latin America, provides significantly discounted rates for first responders
and healthcare professionals who want to book rooms at hotels in close
proximity to the hospitals where they’re working. The rate is available on
Marriott.com at nearly 2,500 hotels.

With both initiatives, our goal is simple – we want to support the
frontline heroes who are selflessly supporting us.

Given the unprecedented disruption to the travel industry, a number of our
hotels have, unfortunately, had to close temporarily. Even as the hotels
were shutting their doors, associates from New Delhi, India to Santos,
Brazil, have found multiple ways to support the communities in which the
hotels are located. The Riviera Marriott Hotel La Porte de Monaco and AC
Hotel Nice, for example, donated all of their unused produce and food
products to a local children’s charity, which provides housing and other
services for endangered children. Many of our properties have contributed
by providing food, pre-packed and cooked meals to crisis relief efforts and
much-needed supplies like cleaning products, masks, gloves, anti-microbial
wipes, sanitizers and shower caps for medical and other frontline workers.
And in a beautiful sign of solidarity among us all, many of our teams have
illuminated their hotel windows with symbols of love and messages of hope
(some of these images are at the top of this email.)
For Our Customers
We remain committed to ensuring our customers experience flexibility during
these challenging times, so we have further extended our cancellation
policy and I wanted to give you an update on those changes.

For guests with *existing reservations for any future arrival date*,
including reservations with pre-paid rates that are typically more
restrictive, we will allow full changes or cancellation without a charge up
to 24 hours prior to arrival, as long as the change or cancellation is made
by June 30, 2020. Please note that any changes to existing reservations
will be subject to availability and any rate differences.

For guests making *new reservations for any future arrival date*, including
reservations with pre-paid rates, between March 13 and June 30, 2020, we
will allow the reservation to be changed or cancelled at no charge up to 24
hours before your scheduled arrival date.

For Our Marriott Bonvoy Members
I also want to take a moment to address our Marriott Bonvoy members. Like
many of you, frequent travel is a way of life for me and most of the
Marriott team. It is the way we connect, get inspired and evolve our
business every day. While it is the right thing to do, it’s been hard not
to be able to travel. We know that when you get back in the air and on the
road, your points and status will be important to you.
*•* *Status Extension:* We want you to be able to enjoy the status that you
earned in 2019. With that in mind, the status you earned in 2019 will be
extended to February 2022.
*•* *Points Expiration:* To provide you ample time to redeem points, the
expiration of points will be paused until February 2021. At that time, your
points will only expire if your account has been inactive for at least 24
months.
As the days unfold, we will continue to monitor and evolve our program
requirements as necessary.

We’ve heard from many of you asking how you can help. Through Marriott
Bonvoy’s Giving Platform
,
you can donate your Marriott Bonvoy points to relief organizations that are
active in COVID-19 responses around the world and that Marriott is also
supporting, including the American Red Cross, International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UNICEF and World Central Kitchen.

Thank you for being a member of our loyalty program or simply for staying
with us – we consider you a part of the extended Marriott family. We will
travel again, and we can’t wait to welcome you back.

Until that day comes, stay well.
*Arne Sorenson*
President and CEO, Marriott International
