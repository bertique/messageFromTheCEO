 | Platinum Medallion®

 Miles






Dear Bert,

I hope wherever you are in the world – whether at home with loved ones or
on the front lines fighting this pandemic – that you are staying healthy
and safe. We thank you for your patience and understanding over the last
month as you’ve experienced unprecedented schedule changes and travel
disruptions. Our focus today, as always, is on getting you and your loved
ones where you need to be quickly and safely.

I want to let you know about some important decisions regarding SkyMiles®
Medallion® Status and benefits, travel waivers and cleanliness that will
help ensure that we’re meeting your needs in this extraordinary time:

   - *Extensions for SkyMiles Members: *I appreciate how much you value
   your Status and benefits, which is why we’re making adjustments
   
so
   you can continue to enjoy them whenever you’re ready to travel again. You
   will see these updates automatically reflected in MyProfile/MyWallet before
   they go into effect.

*Medallion Status:* Your current Medallion Status will automatically be
extended through 2021 whether or not you requalify. In addition, all of
your 2020 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) will be rolled over in 2021.
If you are enrolled in Status promotions, you will also receive additional
flexibility to complete those requirements.

*Program travel benefits:* Eligible Delta SkyMiles American Express Card
Members will get more time to enjoy benefits, including Companion
Certificates and the $100 Delta flight credits. SkyMiles Members with
Upgrade Certificates or $200 Travel Vouchers will also have additional time
to enjoy those benefits.

*Delta Sky Club® access:* If you are a Delta Sky Club Member, you’ll
receive an additional six months of club membership free of charge.

   - *Additional flexibility: *We heard your feedback that you want the
   value of your tickets to be secure and redeemable for a longer period, so
   we have extended the ability to plan, re-book and travel
   
   for up to two years. We’ve waived change fees
   
   for your trips through May 31, 2022 if you have travel booked in April or
   May as of April 3, 2020, or canceled travel/eCredits from flights in March,
   April or May 2020. You can also change new tickets purchased between March
   1 and May 31, 2020, without a change fee for up to a year from the date of
   purchase.


   - *A new standard of Delta Clean: *Your health and safety remain our
   highest priority. We are temporarily streamlining onboard food and beverage
   services domestically
   
   and internationally
   
   to lessen physical touchpoints between you and our crews. The steps we
   continue taking to transform expectations of cleanliness across airports
   and on aircraft are not reserved for times of crisis. They have
become our new
   standard of clean
   
   going forward so you can enjoy peace of mind when you’re ready to fly again.

These are the times that define us all, and I want you to know we are here
for you as you adjust to these extraordinary circumstances. I remain proud
of you and our people as we continue to look out for one another along this
journey. Please continue to take care of yourself and your loved ones.


Sincerely,



*Ed Bastian*
CEO
