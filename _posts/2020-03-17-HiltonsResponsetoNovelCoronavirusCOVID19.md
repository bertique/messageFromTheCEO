At Hilton, we are doing everything we can to ensure your travel safety and
provide maximum flexibility.



Dear Michael,

In these uncertain times, I wanted to reach out to you personally about
what we are doing here at Hilton to support you and your travel plans. As
the situation around novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, we
are doing everything we can to ensure your travel safety and provide
maximum flexibility.

*Your Travel Safety *

As it has always been, the safety and security of our guests and team
members remains our highest priority. We take great pride in maintaining
the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene. In response to the
coronavirus, we have taken additional measures developed in consultation
with global and local public health authorities (including the WHO

and CDC
)
to make our cleaning and hygiene protocols even more rigorous:

   - Our hotel teams are receiving ongoing briefings and enhanced operating
   protocols.
   - We have increased the frequency of cleaning our public areas
   (including lobbies, elevators, door handles, public bathrooms, etc.) and
   have continued the use of hospital-grade disinfectant.
   - We will continue to adjust food and beverage service in accordance
   with current food safety recommendations.
   - We have increased the deployment of antibacterial hand sanitizers.

We have activated our regional and global response teams to provide
around-the-clock assistance to our hotels and are prepared to act swiftly
should we be alerted to a case of coronavirus at one of our properties.

*Your Travel Flexibility *

We remain committed to offering you flexible booking options. Given these
unique circumstances we are making additional adjustments to our individual
booking policies to give you extra peace of mind:

   - *Government Restrictions.* In regions affected by government-issued
   travel restrictions, we will continue to waive change fees or offer full
   refunds. Please click here
   
   for the latest information on our travel waivers.
   - *Existing Reservations.* All reservations – even those described as
   "non-cancellable" (“Advanced Purchase”) – that are scheduled for arrival
   before April 30, 2020, can be changed or cancelled at no charge up to 24
   hours before your scheduled arrival.
   - *New Reservations.* Any reservation you make – even those described as
   “non-cancellable” (“Advanced Purchase”) – that are booked between today and
   April 30, 2020, for any future arrival date, can be changed or cancelled at
   no charge up to 24 hours before your scheduled arrival.

If you need to adjust reservations made via the Hilton website, app or call
center, please contact the Hilton Guest Assistance

team. If you need to adjust reservations made through another travel site,
please contact them for assistance.

*Your Points and Status *

We know that earning Hilton Honors Points and Status is an important way we
show appreciation. We also know the current travel environment may limit
your ability to stay with us.

   - We will pause the expiration of all points scheduled to expire between
   now and May 31, 2020.
   - We will make updates to the requirements for earning tier status for
   2021. Since the situation is still evolving, it is too early to make and
   announce specific changes. We are committed to sharing details as soon as
   possible.

At Hilton, we believe it is in challenging times like these that the power
of hospitality is needed most of all. Whether you are traveling now or in
the future, our team members are ready to welcome you with the Hilton
hospitality you’ve come to expect.


Chris Nassetta
President & CEO, Hilton
