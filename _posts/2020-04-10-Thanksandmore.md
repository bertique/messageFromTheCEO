Hello,

I hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and well, and that you
find yourself managing and moving forward to a better and brighter future.

As the President and Chief Operating Officer of JetBlue, I often have the
honor of speaking on behalf of crewmembers in expressing our collective
gratitude to each of you. Nothing, however, can substitute for hearing
directly from the crewmembers who have created and delivered the signature
JetBlue customer experience to you, every day. It is my honor to introduce
some friends and colleagues who would like to tell you, and the colleagues
they cherish so much, how much they appreciate you:





Please know that we remain committed to not just flying essential routes,
but also to providing humanitarian help wherever and whenever possible to
the cities to which we fly. Our flights are transporting critical
healthcare personnel, medical equipment and supplies to where they are
needed most. Medical personnel flying to assist in the coronavirus response
can request free flights to New York City or any other destination we serve
here
.


The coronavirus is an invisible enemy that has proven itself indifferent in
whom it impacts. It has damaged and caused harm to the unsuspecting and
innocent without regard to age or experience. It is the definition of an
inhumane foe.

Our airline was born 20 years ago to bring humanity back to air travel. It
is with a now broader commitment to humanity itself—and the defeat of this
inhumane virus—that we proudly fly those medical personnel willing to
volunteer their talents to serve in those places where they can do the most
good on behalf of the most at risk.

First responders, everywhere, JetBlue salutes you. Whenever you are ready,
welcome aboard, one and all.

Regards,



Joanna Geraghty
President & Chief Operating Officer, JetBlue Airways
