To our valued customers and partners,

While everyone across the world continues to navigate the uncertainty of
COVID-19, Oracle is committed to supporting your business throughout the
course of this pandemic and to provide continuity of service at all times.

We realize that in this time of crisis, it is critical that we make it
possible for you to continue your operations and help you respond to the
unique demands that you may be facing. We have been in business for decades
doing the most mission critical work that helps telcos keep people
connected, retailers provide food and other necessities, hospitals provide
care, airlines ensure travel, banks help people access funds, insurers
provide benefits, governments keep people safe and informed, utilities keep
everyone’s power on, along with many other critical functions. We want you
to know that at this important time, you can count on us to be there to
support your business.

Oracle’s leadership team is meeting continuously to assess and
appropriately respond to the crisis as it evolves, to adjust our operations
to maintain continuity, and to support the safety and health of those
impacted. In addition, Oracle is operating in accordance with guidance from
local government and public health authorities across the globe. Of course,
the health and welfare of both our employees and your employees remain a
priority. We have put in place many virus-mitigating actions which result
in a reduction of potential transmission. We have extensive online
collaboration capabilities for our employees to communicate with each other
and with you and suppliers. We are working tirelessly to help everyone stay
safe while at the same time continuing to serve you.

Please reach out to your local Oracle team with any additional questions
and concerns. We’ve also added a helpful landing page to answer frequently
asked questions we have received from customers regarding our business
continuity plans. You can find more here

Sincerely,


Safra Catz
CEO

*Frequently Asked Questions*


*1. What is Oracle’s Business Continuity Plan?*
Oracle maintains a robust business continuity management program

reviewed on an annual basis. Individual lines of business across Oracle
have specific plans based on the nature of impacts possible to our business
operations. Oracle takes an impact-based approach to business continuity
management by designing preparedness and response plans that address the
availability of our workforce, workplaces, technologies and critical
interdependencies. Oracle’s employee population size and geographic
diversification provide an inherent resiliency advantage. Finally, offices
experiencing mandatory closures have maintained essential business
processes and customer support resulting in no disruptions to customer
services to date.

*2. Will my cloud services be impacted?*
Oracle remains committed to meeting its service level agreements for our
cloud services. We’ve designed our 2nd Generation Cloud Infrastructure and
Industry leading SaaS applications for maximum availability and resilience.
We also have a robust capacity management process to provide cloud service
scalability. At this time, we do not expect any disruption to cloud service
availability due to the COVID-19 virus.

*3. Will there be delays in Oracle’s supply chain due to COVID-19?*
Oracle is committed to upholding the terms and agreements set with your
company. We maintain a multi-sourcing strategy for most of our components,
and Oracle works continuously to avoid delays that impact customers. For
products or components supplied predominantly from high-risk countries, we
are expanding our alternate sourcing options to minimize potential future
disruptions.

*4. What impact is COVID-19 having on lead times for hardware?*
If COVID-19 continues to intensify, lead times may further increase. Oracle
is working diligently to minimize potential added lengthening of lead
times, and we will keep you informed on any impacts that would affect your
business.

*5. What impact, if any, will there be to receiving spare parts?*
At this time, we do not expect issues in providing spare parts. Currently,
the only delays we are experiencing are with delivery to customers who have
limited access to their sites or where there are transportation delays.

*6. Do you have any concerns regarding support or staffing for hardware
replacements or installs for customers?*
Oracle’s employee population depth and geographic diversity provide
inherent resilience to the continuity of our hardware and services
globally. We are committed to meeting all our agreements throughout this
situation, so that your business can continue to operate as normal.

*7. How can I get updates on COVID-19 from Oracle?*
Oracle will advise you of any important service notifications via your
standard account contacts and communication channels. If you have any
questions or concerns regarding COVID-19, Oracle requests that they be
channeled through your existing Account Management or Account Service teams
that you use for all routine business communications. For global Customer
