Our Top Priority: You, Our Guests
  


Dear Bertmichael,
For more than 90 years, Marriott has lived by a core value established by
our founder, JW Marriott, Sr., to "take care of our guests and associates."
This enduring value guides us as we face the difficult challenge of
responding to the coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health
Organization declared a pandemic on Wednesday.

Our hearts and thoughts go out to the people who have been affected by this
unprecedented event and we appreciate the healthcare workers, local
communities, and governments around the world who are on the front line
working to contain this coronavirus. Please know that we are vigilantly
monitoring the COVID-19 situation around the clock and have precautions in
place to ensure a healthy stay at any of our hotels across the globe.

In this climate, we know travel may not be your first thought, but I want
you to know the safety of our guests and associates is our top priority. I
want to thank you in advance for putting your trust in Marriott as you plan
for future travels. Below is an update on what we are doing, keeping your
safety top of mind.
When You Book
You should have confidence when you book a stay at any of our hotels across
the globe that we are doing everything we can to have accommodations ready
for you. We are closely monitoring the World Health Organization (WHO), the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local health agencies
for the latest developments related to COVID-19 and following the guidance
of government and public health officials. We are reinforcing these
agencies' recommendations on the appropriate health and safety measures
with our own hotel management teams and the hotel operators in our
portfolio.
Before Your Stay
Given the impact of COVID-19 on how we work, socialize and travel, we have
been adapting our cancellation policy over the past several weeks to the
evolving nature of this epidemic. Today, we are updating our policy to
provide our customers the most flexibility we can offer during these
challenging times. Generally speaking, for guests with existing individual
reservations, including reservations with pre-paid rates that are typically
more restrictive, we will allow changes or cancellation without a charge up
to 24 hours prior to arrival as long as the change or cancellation is made
by April 30, 2020. For guests making new individual reservations between
today and April 30, 2020, we will allow those reservations to be changed or
cancelled at no charge up to 24 hours before a guest's scheduled arrival
date. Please visit our website

for the most up-to-date information and for additional details about
availability and exclusions.
During Your Stay
We recognize that the COVID-19 virus has required all of us to be more
mindful as we go through our regular activities. Daily, our hotels around
the world are working to ensure that they meet the latest guidance from the
CDC and WHO on hygiene and cleaning. Our hotels' health and safety measures
are designed to address a broad spectrum of viruses, including COVID-19,
and cover everything from handwashing hygiene and cleaning product
specifications to guest room and common area cleaning procedures. Specific
steps we are taking as a company can be found on our website
.

For Our Marriott Bonvoy Members
We are focused on how the coronavirus is impacting our Marriott Bonvoy
Members and have made some important updates to our loyalty program to
provide greater flexibility when planning future travel. Specifically, we
have paused points expiration until August 31, 2020 allowing Members ample
time to redeem their points. In addition, we have extended the expiration
of suite night awards (SNAs) with an expiration date of December 31, 2020
by one year to December 31, 2021. Lastly, Members who currently have an
active Free Night Award (FNA) expiring in 2020 as part of their credit card
benefit, annual choice benefit, promotions or travel package will be able
to use it through January 31, 2021. We understand that earning status for
2021 may also be on your mind. As the current situation is still evolving,
it is too early for us to make any changes. We will keep you updated on all
loyalty program changes through our Marriott Bonvoy member benefits website
.


We recognize that these are unsettling times and whether you are traveling
now or in the future, we want you to know that your safety and wellbeing
are our first priority.

Whenever you travel, we are waiting with open doors and open hearts to
serve you.
Arne Sorenson
President and CEO, Marriott International
