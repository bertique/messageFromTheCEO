  Keeping you informed with the latest information
  Dear Bert,
It is more important than ever to us that we stay connected and keep our
most loyal guests – our members – informed on how IHG® is responding to the
Coronavirus pandemic.

*Cancellation Policy & Booking Flexibly *

Most of our members and guests simply cannot travel right now and our goal
is to offer you flexibility for the plans you already had in place, as well
as plans you may want to make for the future:

   - We have updated our cancellation policy for existing bookings
   (bookings made through April 6) which can now be changed or cancelled for
   stays through June 30, 2020.
   - You can read the full details of our policy here
   .
   To change or cancel your reservation visit Manage Your Stay
    or call
our Reservations
   and Customer Care team
   .
   - If you are looking ahead, we want to give you the confidence and
   flexibility to book with IHG. Our new *Book Now, Pay Later
   *
   rate offers both flexibility and savings – including no deposit and
   cancellations up to 24 hours before your stay, meaning travel planning is
   commitment free. Read all about this and our other flexible rates here
   
   .
   - As an IHG Rewards Club member, you also benefit from our Member
   Exclusive Rates that give you additional savings.

*IHG Rewards Club Update *

We are committed to supporting our members to manage their loyalty activity:

   - Last month we announced we have reduced the Elite membership criteria
   required (nights or points) this year.
   - We also want to remind you of a unique benefit of our program – points
   never expire for all members with Elite status (Gold Elite, Platinum Elite,
   and Spire Elite).
      - For Club members points only expire after 12 months of inactivity.
      So, for members with points due to expire from April 1 we are
extending the
      expiration date to December 31, 2020.
   - In addition, there are many ways to keep your account active,
      including donating your points
      
      to our True Hospitality for Good partner, the *International
      Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies*, which have
      activated a COVID-19 fund to provide medical assistance for those in need.
   - Read a full update on our loyalty changes here
   
   – including information on anniversary night certificates earned through
   IHG Rewards Club credit cards in the US and UK.

We continue to monitor the evolving situation and keep our cancellation
policy and amendments to our loyalty program under constant review. To see
the latest details please always refer to our website here

*Your Health & Well-being*

Our number one priority is always the health, safety and well-being of our
guests and colleagues. We continue to provide guidance to our hotels, so
they follow comprehensive health and safety procedures from all the
relevant authorities and organizations. This means hotels must also change
the way in which they operate several services. Depending on local
legislation and best practice, this could include a reduction in restaurant
and bar service and alternative guest room furnishings and/or amenities.
All changes are made with the safety of our guests and colleagues as our
main consideration and are temporary but essential, as we all play our part
to help flatten the curve. We will reinstate services to the brand
experience you expect as soon as possible. In the meantime, we thank you
for your patience and apologize for any inconvenience this causes.

Given the extensive impact on travel, hotels in some locations have had to
take the incredibly tough decision to temporarily close. Guests with
impacted reservations at these hotels will be contacted by IHG, your travel
agent or the online booking platform you booked through. This, of course,
has also impacted some of our talented and passionate hotel colleagues and
we are doing all we can to support them – including helping find temporary
employment opportunities through our IHG Hotel Colleague Job Center.


*Supporting our Communities*

The hospitality industry has always prided itself on its role within local
communities. At IHG we call this *True Hospitality* – and that is what our
teams pride themselves on delivering every day to guests around the world.
In the current circumstances we are not able to do that in the way we
normally would, but that hasn’t stopped them from finding new ways to
support those around us. I could not be prouder of the thousands of hotels
colleagues who are adapting to changes rapidly and doing everything they
can to provide a safe shelter to those who need it most. Especially those
hotels that are now a home to essential workers and those on the front line
of battling COVID-19.




On behalf of everyone at IHG, I would like to personally thank you for the
trust and support you have in us, and we look forward to welcoming you to
an IHG hotel soon. In the meantime, take care of yourselves, your family
and friends.

Best wishes,



*Keith Barr*
Chief Executive Officer
