To Our Valued Customers,

At Newegg, we’re closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and working tirelessly to serve the needs of businesses and individuals who are quickly adapting to new ways of life as we all pull together to curtail this outbreak. In response to the virus, we’ve implemented updated best practices in our workplace to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers.

Putting our Employees and Customers First
In accordance with California’s recent statewide stay-at-home order, most employees in our Los Angeles area headquarters are now working from home. We have temporarily limited on-site business operations to essential staff in our warehouses to ensure fulfilment and delivery of customer orders with minimal interruption, especially those relying on Newegg to deliver household staples, medical supplies and other necessities. These essential employees adhere to recommended hygiene and social distancing practices, and we’ve increased janitorial services to preserve a clean, healthy work environment.

These precautions are designed to ensure customer orders are picked, packed and shipped by healthy employees. Once a package leaves our warehouse, it’s entrusted to one of our shipping partners. A large percentage of these orders are delivered via UPS or the US Postal Service, both of which are taking steps to ensure the health of their employees and safe parcel delivery. UPS published its COVID-19 response here published by the CDC. Newegg and its fulfilment partners are pulling together to deliver the highest, healthiest level of service to our customers.

Fair Pricing Commitment
Newegg is committed to fair pricing. If you suspect a product is priced dramatically higher than it should be, please let us know so we can investigate and fix the problem. Supply chain fluctuations and big swings in consumer demand are placing unprecedented pressure on the e-commerce system as a whole, and we’re grateful to you – our loyal customers – for helping to ensure pricing remains fair, especially during trying times like these.

Supplying the Remote Workforce
More employees than ever before are working from home – some by choice, others out of necessity. We recently launched a Work From Home portal in response to the sharp, recent increase in searches for products such as webcams, laptop computers and other products suited to remote work. Newegg will continue to monitor product category searches to ensure the selection of products available evolves with customer demand.

Looking Ahead
The COVID-19 situation remains fluid, and Newegg is committed to helping customers manage through this difficult time. We will continue to monitor and respond to federal, state and local health authorities to protect our employees and serve our customers safely, and with minimal disruption.

Sincerely,

Anthony Chow
Chief Executive Officer, Newegg Inc.
