How we’re supporting our restaurants, drivers and you.


[Grubhub] 



To our Grubhub community,

I wanted to personally connect with you about the actions we’re taking to help you, our restaurant partners, and our drivers, to ensure the health and safety of everyone while supporting our entire community.

With dine-in down as much as 75%, local restaurants need our support more than ever. As their partner, it is Grubhub’s responsibility to step up during this difficult time. So, we are deferring commission fees for impacted independent restaurants.

Delaying our revenue will increase the restaurant's cash flow, allowing them to pay their employees and weather this difficult situation. We are also matching all promotions run by independent restaurants with our Smart Promotions feature, to help make their investments in growth twice as effective.

To provide additional financial relief for our drivers and restaurants, we created the Grubhub Community Relief Fund. With this fund, all of your Donate the Change contributions will go to charitable organizations that support drivers and restaurants impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

Local independent restaurants are the lifeblood of our communities and we must do everything we can to get them through this time of uncertainty. With empty dining rooms, restaurants are depending on pickup and delivery orders more than ever.

Using Contact-free delivery at checkout, you can safely continue to support your favorite local restaurants. For the safety of you and our drivers, drivers will call/text when they arrive and drop off your order on the doorstep, in the lobby or other area designated by you. This option is now available on the website and latest version of the app.

Another way to support your favorite local restaurants is to order pickup. For some customers, pickup has proven to be a great alternative to dining in—with less person-to-person contact.

I want to thank you personally for working with us to support your local independent restaurants. These family restaurants have served us consistently over the years and it is our privilege to step in and serve them now when there is so much at stake.

Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this worldwide crisis.

Thank you,

Matt Maloney, Founder and CEO
