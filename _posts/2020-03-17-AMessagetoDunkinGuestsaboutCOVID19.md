[Dunkin’]

Valued Dunkin’ Guests,

We have a saying here at Dunkin’ about how we treat each other: We’ve got your back.

As we navigate through the challenges of COVID-19, I want to reinforce our ongoing actions to ensure the health and safety of our guests, franchisees, employees and the communities we serve.

“We’ve got your back” means:

•       For the Restaurants … Our restaurants in the U.S. will have reduced hours and will be limited to drive-thru and/or carry-out-only service. We have removed access to seating and tables from the dining and patio area. We have increased standards on the frequency of handwashing and cleaning procedures, including disinfecting high-use surfaces and high-traffic areas.
•       For the Restaurant Employees … Our franchisees are taking care of their crew and managers, and are committed to providing a clean and healthy work environment for all employees. To keep everyone safe, we are stressing the importance of social distancing in our restaurants. The reduced operating hours will allow our restaurant employees to focus on their families as well.
•       For Our Guests … We’re focused on making your experience as frictionless as possible, whether through our 5,300+ drive-thru locations, On-the-Go and other providers. Rest assured, we are committed to providing a safe, secure experience at Dunkin’ — offering you something familiar and welcoming amid so much change.

For more than 70 years, Dunkin’ has been at the heart of the communities we serve, keeping America running and taking care of our guests. We are grateful for the dedication of our franchisees and crew members, who make our brand stand tall every day. We’re continuing our legacy of being there when people need us most by taking these additional steps to be your place of comfort during all of this uncertainty.

As always, here at Dunkin', we've got your back!

Sincerely,

Dave Hoffmann
CEO, Dunkin’ Brands
