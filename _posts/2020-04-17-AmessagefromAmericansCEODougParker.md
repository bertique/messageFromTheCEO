View on the web

Hello  AAdvantage® member

American Airlines CEO, Doug Parker, provides an update on what American is
doing to care for customers, team members and the communities we serve
throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation.

Learn about:

   - How we've updated the flight experience and implemented social
   distancing measures on our aircraft to ensure your safety and the safety of
   the American Airlines team members serving you.
   - Our gratitude for support from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
   - Flexibility when planning or rebooking upcoming travel, which includes
   the ability to cancel your plans for flights through September of 2020, and
   fly anytime by the end of 2021 without incurring any change fees.
   - Enhancements to the AAdvantage® program allowing for continued elite
   status through early 2022.
   - Our unwavering commitment to the communities where our customers and
   team members live and work through our partnerships with the American Red
   Cross, local hospitals and more.

American is committed to keeping you updated and we look forward to
welcoming you onboard when the time is right for you.

Thank you for flying American.
