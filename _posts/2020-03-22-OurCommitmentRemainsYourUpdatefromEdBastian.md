Dear Bert,

It has been an extraordinary few weeks as our world faces historic
challenges with the growing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Amid the
stress and uncertainty, it’s never been more critical to stay connected
with one another, even as we practice social distancing to reduce
transmission and keep each other healthy and safe. I remain dedicated to
keeping you informed about the actions Delta is taking for you during this
uncertain time.

We are committed to:

   - *Prioritizing your safety while traveling. *Your care and safety
   remain our top priority, and we continue to make long-term investments that
   will raise the bar on cleanliness. Changes we’ve announced to streamline
   cleaning just this week include removing non-essential items from seat-back
   pockets, including the removal of *Sky* magazine until further notice.
   In addition, we are using an EPA-registered disinfectant to clean all
   aircraft and fogging
   
   an increasing number of flights with the same disinfectant. And Delta
   people are being supplied with wellness items such as gloves and cleaning
   wipes to ensure high-traffic surface areas are disinfected. To keep you
   informed, we’ve established a new line of communication – just text 27535
   (or ‘ASKDL’) to receive pre-populated information about airport and
   aircraft cleanliness as well as travel guidance from the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization
   (WHO).


   - *Making travel changes easier.* As the situation evolves, your
   flexibility when traveling remains our focus. To that end, we’ve simplified
   our waivers
   
   for making changes, including extending our domestic travel waiver through
   May 31. We are now waiving all change fees for U.S. domestic and
   international travel departing in March, April or May 2020 as well as
   tickets purchased in March 2020. Rest assured that the value of your ticket
   won’t be lost if you decide to make adjustments. The unprecedented volume
   of changes has been an unexpected challenge for our Reservations team. They
   continue to work around the clock to assist your urgent needs, and we
   sincerely appreciate your patience. For eligible SkyMiles®
Medallion® Members,
   we’ve extended upgrade certificates and $200 Delta travel vouchers, and for
   eligible Delta SkyMiles American Express Card Members, we’ve extended
   Companion Certificates. Now, you will have until the end of 2020 to enjoy
   those benefits that were originally expiring before June 30. We will keep
   you informed on additional decisions as we evaluate overall Medallion
   Status and promotions.


   - *Protecting Delta’s future*. We want to be transparent about the fact
   that your travel experience will change throughout the coming months as we
   protect your health and safety, and work to emerge and recover from this
   crisis. This includes the difficult decision to temporarily close many of
   our Delta Sky Clubs
   ®
   and reduce onboard offerings. I know it’s not easy to give up amenities
   you deserve and have come to love, and we are committed to bringing them
   back as quickly as possible. I appreciate your patience and understanding.


   - *Creating connections during extraordinary circumstances. *Amid the
   challenges we are all facing, you and our people continue to inspire me
   every day. I appreciate the countless messages many of you have shared
   praising our employees, as well as those who have reached out to let us
   know you can’t wait for your next adventure aboard Delta once we’re through
   this crisis. Thank you for your inspiring words.

The Delta family has made it through hard times before and will get through
this, by staying true to our values of service, integrity and honesty at
all times. Thank you for your continued support as we navigate this
challenge, and I hope everyone remains healthy and safe.


Sincerely,



*Ed Bastian*
CEO
