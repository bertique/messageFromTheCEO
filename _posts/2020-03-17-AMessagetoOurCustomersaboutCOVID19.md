Our commitment to your safety

To Our Customers,
Over the past few weeks, it’s become clear that the world is facing an unprecedented challenge. Like you, we are deeply concerned and want to do what we can to help keep our communities and our families safe and healthy.
On behalf of Bed Bath & Beyond, I wanted to send a personal note to you to let you know how we are responding to the situation. We are humbled by your loyalty, and we take our responsibility to our customers, our teams, and our partners very seriously.
From the onset of this situation, we have been listening to the appropriate sources for accurate and up-to-date information, and our preparedness plan reflects those inputs. As things evolve, we are actively monitoring the situation and assessing risks, and are ready to implement immediate changes to ensure a high level of safety. We will continue to communicate with you in a timely and transparent way so you can continue to shop with us with confidence.
What We're Doing:
• We are introducing rigorous additional cleaning procedures, and are increasing the number of wipes, hand sanitizers, and other cleaning materials available at check-outs and throughout our stores for associates and customers to use. We've also suspended all in-store food sampling events during this time.

• We are working around the clock to ensure our customers have access to the products they want and need, especially items that keep their families safe and well. We have implemented limits on certain purchases so that everyone has an opportunity to obtain in-demand items when available. We are also making it easier to find the products you need quickly, in-store or online, or simply utilize our “Reserve online, pickup in store” option.

• We’re taking sensible steps to help protect our team of associates. This means fewer meetings, limiting travel, and making it easier for our people to take the time they need to care for themselves or their families in the event they are directly affected by COVID-19.

• We are monitoring new developments so that we can quickly adapt and continue to provide the products you need and the best possible experience in-store and online.
We recognize this is a challenging time for all, and we remain deeply committed to the safety of our customers, teams, and communities.
Our customers are the heart of our company and we look forward to welcoming and serving you wherever and however you choose to shop with us.
Please take care of yourselves and each other,
