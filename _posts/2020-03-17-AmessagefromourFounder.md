To our guests,

First and foremost, we want to express our sincere concern for everyone who
has been impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19).

For more than 40 years The Cheesecake Factory has been dedicated to genuine
hospitality and taking great care of our people so they can take great care
of you.

The health and wellbeing of our staff members and guests is always our
number one concern, and we wanted to share with you some actions we’ve
taken to ensure your continued safety during this time of uncertainty.

We are continuing to maintain our high level of cleanliness and sanitation
practices in all of our restaurants.

You may notice some changes the next time you dine with us as we have
adapted some of our operational procedures as precautionary measures.  Here
are a few examples:


   - We have transitioned to silverware rolled in linen napkins to keep our
   utensils from being out in the open.
   - We have also removed the salt and pepper shakers from our tables and
   have made them available upon guest request.
   - Additionally, at the end of your meal should you prefer to wrap-up
   your own leftovers at your table, our staff will gladly provide you with
   containers.
   - If you’d like to learn more of what we are doing, please *click here

We care deeply about our people.  They are what makes our company so
special.  We are ensuring that our teams have the information they need to
remain healthy and are instructing them to stay home if they’re not feeling
well and are providing paid time off during their illness.  We are making
sure none of our staff members lose the ability to maintain their benefits
during this time.

We have been following the guidance of the CDC and our local health
departments and will continue to do so throughout this evolving situation.

We encourage you to stay healthy and we look forward to serving you soon.

Sincerely,
*David Overton*
Chairman, Founder & CEO, The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated

*David M. Gordon*
President, The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated
