Committed to keeping you connected.


To our customers,

Together, we find ourselves in an extraordinary situation with COVID-19. In
the past few weeks, things have moved very quickly, and this pandemic is
affecting all of our communities, our families and our very way of life.

We are here to help you–we know how critical it is that you stay connected
to essential services, including Internet, TV and phone. We also need to
keep our employees safe and healthy, which is why we're continuing to make
operational changes.

*Meeting Customer Needs*
Here are some of the ways that Xfinity is at your service and keeping you
connected:

•
*We continue to focus on network reliability and performance,* with network
engineers, operations centers and maintenance crews working 24/7 to ensure
that our services continue to perform as you expect and need.

•
*Everyone can access out-of-home WiFi hotspots:* Xfinity WiFi Hotspots in
out-of-home locations are available for free to anyone who needs them to
support communities through this challenging time. Follow instructions at
xfinity.com/wifi

to join a hotspot.

•
*More entertainment content is now available for you to watch for free:* We
have worked with our partners to provide a range of additional free content
to keep you entertained while you're at home. You can find it by saying
*"Free"* into your Xfinity Voice Remote.

•
*We are continuing to grow the educational resources available for school
age children*, with new content from Curiosity Stream, History Vault,
Reading Corner, Kids Room, and Great Lectures. You can find this by saying
*"Education"* into your Xfinity Voice Remote.

•
*We are bringing select new release movies straight to X1:* As movie
theaters close and more and more people remain home, we have made select
new release pictures available on X1 including: *Onward, The Invisible Man*
and *Emma*.

•
*We have phone support and a range of digital tools to manage your
services:* We have already transitioned thousands of customer service
representatives to work from home. We have teams working around the clock
to help our call centers make this transition to work from home while
continuing to support our customers. We appreciate your patience in case
you experience longer wait times with our phone representatives. It may be
faster to use our digital tools to manage your services or get help. These
robust digital tools deliver quick, individualized support, and you can
learn more about these tools here

and below.

*Protecting our Employees and Customers*
We appreciate your patience as we implement new guidelines to help keep our
customers and our teammates safe and healthy:

•
*We are reducing our store hours and the services available in-store:*
Xfinity Stores provide essential support to keep you connected to your
Internet, TV, home phone and mobile services. We want to continue to meet
the needs of customers while limiting potential exposure of our employees
and customers.

We have reduced our store hours, increased cleanings, instituted social
distancing practices, and limited the services available in-store to the
following: equipment exchanges, kiosk bill payments, new Internet equipment
pick-up and mobile device replacement ordering. To check the status and
hours of an Xfinity Store, visit xfinity.com/stores
.


•
*Our technicians will only enter customers' homes when necessary:* Our
technicians will only enter customers' homes when it's necessary, to ensure
they are connected to essential services that they need right now. We have
increased safety measures, such as asking our technicians to do daily
temperature checks and additional sanitization practices. We have also
given our technicians new guidelines for customer interactions to help keep
them and you safe at this time.

•
*Working from home:* To support public health efforts, we've asked every
employee who is able to work from home, to do so, in every office across
the country. This includes thousands of customer service representatives
who are continuing to work to meet your needs–on the phone or in chat–in
the event you need more assistance than our digital tools provide.

We will continue to work hard to deliver the services you depend on and
provide frequent updates on those efforts. For the latest information on
our response to the coronavirus and tips, please visit xfinity.com/prepare

Thank you for continuing to trust Xfinity to keep you connected, and please
stay safe.
