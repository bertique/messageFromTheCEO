Policy Number

CEO, we recognize the uncertainty and financial challenges you may be
facing as the nation bands together to slow the spread of coronavirus. To
help our customers, we are taking the following action:
Personal Auto Customer Relief Refund

Fewer drivers are on the road, which means fewer accidents. With this in
mind, we are announcing our Personal Auto Customer Relief Refund, which
will return approximately $250 million to our customers. Here's how it
works:


Personal auto insurance customers will receive a 15% refund on two months
of their auto premium, based on your premium amount as of April 7, 2020.1


We are planning to issue the refund in the manner you made your most recent
payment or by check.


We will begin issuing refunds in the coming weeks, after we have approval
from state insurance regulators.


Your refund will happen automatically, and you do not need to call us to
get your refund.

Please visit *libertymutual.com/covid-19*

for the latest information. In the meantime, stay well and thank you for
being a Liberty Mutual customer.

Sincerely,

David Long
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
