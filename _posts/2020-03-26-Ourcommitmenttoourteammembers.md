An Update from our CEO‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

To our Chipotle guests,

Ensuring the safety of our employees and our guests during this time is our greatest priority. As new information is issued daily surrounding COVID-19, we’re doing our part to help combat the spread, while continuing to safely provide food for our guests. Restaurants are considered an essential service which means Chipotle can continue Cultivating a Better World by providing guests real, freshly made food for takeout, pick-up and delivery at a time where options are limited.

We’ve been asked what Chipotle is doing for restaurant employees who are working tirelessly prepping, cooking and serving you real food daily during this dynamic situation. Effective immediately, we’ll be offering a 10% increase in hourly pay for restaurant employees who work between March 16 and April 12, 2020. This assistance pay is simply one of the ways that we’re expressing our appreciation for those who are willing and able to continue working during this time.

In addition to a pay increase, we have also expanded our emergency leave benefits to accommodate those directly affected by COVID-19. These individuals may receive pay equal to their upcoming 2-week schedule or average hours worked, whichever is greater. At Chipotle, employees never have to choose between work and taking care of themselves. Health and safety are our top priority and our policy has always been and will continue to be, if an employee is sick, they stay home and are welcomed back when they’re symptom free. All Chipotle employees are entitled to paid sick leave starting on the first day of employment in addition to vacation, paid time off and personal leave options.

Employees and their families also have access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and HealthAdvocate, which grants 24/7 virtual access to doctors with $1 co-pay regardless of whether or not they’re enrolled in one of our healthcare plans. Additionally, for those utilizing our debt-free degrees or tuition reimbursement programs, Chipotle is not enforcing the hourly work requirements this semester. We recognize that some individuals may be unable to work right now, and we want to ensure that employees can further their education with continued financial assistance from Chipotle.

We’re committed to keeping you informed as we navigate through this evolving situation together. We are continuing to adhere to the guidance of the CDC, FDA, and local officials to make choices in the best interest of our employees, our guests and the community. We will get through this together.

Thank you,
[Brian Niccol]
