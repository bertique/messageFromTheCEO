Dear ,

I recently received an inspiring note from a medical professional who flew
Delta to perform three lifesaving surgeries on children. It was a reminder
that travel continues to be essential for many who are on the front lines
responding to this pandemic, and why, if you must fly, our work to
transport you safely is more important than ever.

For those of you who cannot travel right now, our mission is to serve you
by helping with the crisis response. In addition to flying medical
volunteers

free of charge to some of the hardest-hit areas in the U.S., Delta has
joined brands across the globe in partnering with health and community
organizations. That includes our cargo division transporting critical
supplies where they are most needed, like the 500,000 surgical masks

delivered to Michigan last weekend for nurses and doctors on the front
lines. With changes to onboard and Delta Sky Club® offerings, we
donated 200,000
pounds of food

to hospitals, food banks and other community groups, while face shields

manufactured by Delta Flight Products are being used by hospital workers in
New York and Atlanta.

Through it all, I am humbled by the ways you continue to heal our
communities and embody the hope we need today. When you must travel:

   - *Your safety remains paramount. *Following the CDC’s recommendation,
   we’re providing face masks to employees, and I encourage you to bring a
   face mask for your own protection. And new initiatives will make space
   for safer travel
   
   through June 30 by blocking middle seats, limiting the number of people on
   each flight, boarding by rows from back to front, and pausing automatic
   advanced Medallion® Complimentary Upgrades to process them at the gate.
   - *Flexibility is important in uncertain times.* Since the last update,
   change fee waivers have been extended to allow travel through Sept. 30,
   2022
   ,
   for customers who have upcoming travel booked as of today through Sept. 30,
   2020, or have canceled travel from flights in March through Sept. 30, 2020.

We remain committed to taking care of the Delta people who take care of
you, and are thankful to members of Congress, the President and the
Administration for recognizing the importance of our people and industry
via the CARES Act payroll protection
.
This bipartisan support will help ensure that air travel plays a leading
role in the recovery once the pandemic is contained, and that our people
will be positioned to serve you when you’re ready to resume flying.

As everyone adapts to this new normal, many of you are posting on social
media reminiscing about your favorite destinations and where you hope to
travel with us next. Thank you for those shared moments. We can’t wait for
the day when we’re taking you on your next adventure and appreciate your
support.
Sincerely,
*Ed Bastian*
CEO
