Dear Traveler,
At Expedia, we believe in the power of travel: to create joy, to bring
people together, to enrich our hearts and minds. With the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) now declared a global pandemic, we cannot help but think of all
those we know and care about around the world, including you, whom we have
had the privilege to serve. So I wanted to contact you personally to share
more about what we are doing.
*Staying Informed and Healthy *
First and foremost, we care about everyone’s safety, and are closely
monitoring the situation and guidance from the World Health Organization
(WHO)
,
as well as our travel partners, to ensure we are giving you the most
up-to-date information possible. Because the situation and policies vary by
location, we encourage everyone to stay informed and follow the
recommendations of your local health authorities.
No matter where you live, and whether you are traveling or not, it’s worth
our repeating the WHO’s advice for protecting yourself and others: Wash
your hands frequently with soap and/or alcohol-based sanitizers; avoid
touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; cover your mouth or nose when you
sneeze or cough; and maintain distance between yourself and anyone who is
coughing or sneezing. Of course, if you have a fever, cough, or difficulty
breathing yourself, seek medical attention.
*Helping Our Customers *
For those traveling now and with upcoming travel bookings, our teams are
working around the clock to provide everyone the support they need. We are
rapidly increasing the availability of travel advisors, enhancing our
self-service options, and developing new automated ways for travelers to
better manage their reservations. Our focus is helping travelers with
immediate trips, and these improvements will allow all our customers to
travel more confidently in the future.
*Recommending Flexible Options*
If you are planning new travel, we strongly encourage you to book options
with built-in flexibility like free cancellation and changes. Look for the
updated messaging regarding these options and other choices on our site and
mobile app.

We recognize that these are uncertain times. At Expedia one thing we know
is that for people and communities around the globe, travel is a force for
good. Whenever you are ready to travel again, please know that we are ready
to serve you.
