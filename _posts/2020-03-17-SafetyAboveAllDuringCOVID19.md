We recognize the trust you place in us when we deliver to your doorstep,
shipping dock or place of business.

That’s why I want to share an update on the actions we are taking at FedEx
to keep you – and our team members – safe amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.

“Safety Above All” is something we take incredibly seriously at FedEx. We
are listening to recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) as we strive
to help protect our customers and our team members.

We are giving our team members facts about COVID-19 and reminding them to
follow simple but effective steps to keep them safe such as frequent
handwashing. We are disinfecting our facilities and equipment as
appropriate. And as always, we are encouraging our team members to take any
signs of illness seriously and seek medical attention as needed.

In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, you may have wondered, “Is that package
safe to touch?” The WHO has answered that question for us
.
They’ve made it clear that it is safe to handle a package, even if it comes
from a place where the virus has been reported.

As with prior disaster-related situations around the globe, we quickly
jumped in to help with relief efforts as the outbreak began, working with
humanitarian aid organizations to deliver critical supplies such as masks
and disposable medical gloves. I am so proud to be part of a team that is
always ready to extend a helping hand to communities in need.

With new restrictions and limitations coming out daily to help contain the
spread of the virus, we’ve created a site dedicated to the latest
information

on how we’re responding to this very dynamic situation. Thank you for
putting your trust in us, and we remain focused on serving you.
