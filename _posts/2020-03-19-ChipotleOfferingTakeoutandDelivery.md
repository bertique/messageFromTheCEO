An Update from our CEO‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

To our Chipotle guests,

We are working diligently to ensure that we’re doing everything possible to keep our guests and our employees safe during this time of extreme uncertainty. We have closely partnered with the CDC, FDA, and local officials for guidance while navigating these evolving circumstances.

Mandates have been put in place for restaurants to suspend in-restaurant dining in various areas of the country. Therefore, we have proactively made the decision to temporarily offer a “to-go only” option in all 2,600 locations across the country to help combat the spread of COVID-19.

Here’s how you can still get our real food today:

  *   Order in-restaurant for takeout only: Guests can still come into the restaurant and place their order to-go.

  *   The Chipotle Delivery Kitchens: Download the Chipotle App for Apple. Pick-up directly from our mobile shelves or get delivery. We have suspended all delivery fees throughout March to ensure we’re making it easy for our guests.

The news surrounding COVID-19 is constantly changing so we’ll be keeping you updated as we adjust and pivot accordingly. At Chipotle, health and safety isn’t a set of processes and procedures, it’s part of our culture. In addition to our industry leading food safety protocols, we’ve taken additional precautions recently to safeguard our employees and our guests. These include: increased sanitization of high-touch, high-traffic areas; elevated frequency of personal hygiene requirements; and a tamper evident packaging seal for mobile pick-up and delivery orders. Customers can also leave instructions in our app and online to request contactless deliveries.

Cultivating a better world takes commitment from all of us. We must band together during this time and support one another. We appreciate your understanding, trust and patience.

Thank you,
[Brian Niccol]
