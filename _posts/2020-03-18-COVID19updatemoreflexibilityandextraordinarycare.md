Dear Customer,

Since my email to you last week, we’ve continued to see the extraordinary
impact of coronavirus COVID-19 and how it is disrupting so much of our
daily lives. All of us at Hertz are constantly reviewing the latest
developments around the world, and we are working diligently to support our
employees who are supporting you.

I want to share some additional measures we are taking to demonstrate our
commitment to keeping you informed and going the extra mile to get you
where you need to be safely and with confidence.

*Cleaning *
• Around the world, we have enhanced our cleaning methods at our locations
and our shuttle buses including using approved disinfectant to regularly
wipe down high-touch areas such as door handles, counters, kiosks and other
hard surfaces.
• We’ve added more alcohol-based hand sanitizers and are reminding
employees to take important hygiene steps, including frequent handwashing
and staying home if ill.
• For our vehicles, we are reinforcing our rigorous cleaning process which
includes priority areas such as door handles, steering wheel, dashboard,
console, seats, etc.
*Flexible Reservations *
We know you need greater flexibility to manage the change happening around
us. Here are few recent changes we’ve made to help you.
• We have waived young renter fees and lowered the renter age from 20 to 18
years old to help college students and young drivers returning home or
needing transportation.
• We added flexibility for prepaid reservations, including waiving
cancellation and change fees for travel restricted areas. Additionally, all
prepaid reservations booked prior to March 13 can now be extended toward
reservations used within 24 months with no fees. Click here

for more details.
• For reservations made with Gold Plus Rewards points prior to March 13, we
will waive change or cancellation point loss.
• And as always, Hertz’s pay later option has the ultimate flexibility with
no cancellation fees, ever.
As the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, please know we remain
committed to providing you the exceptional experience and service you
expect from Hertz.

Sincerely,
Jodi Allen
Hertz Chief Marketing & Customer Care Officer
