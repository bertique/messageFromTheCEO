Dear ,

By now, you'll have received plenty of communications from the brands that
are part of your daily life – including several from us – as we've moved
quickly to respond to the unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic.

As we move into the second full month of our country's efforts to fight the
spread, it feels like a time to not just reflect on what we've experienced
so far, but to reaffirm our commitments to you for the days ahead:

*We're in this with you.*
Almost every person and business around the world has had to change the
ways in which it works, and we're no exception. If you've called our team
in recent days and heard a barking dog or child in the background, this may
come as no surprise – in fact, over 99% of our company is now operating
from home. Many of us, including members of my family, have also adjusted
to doing our best as part-time childhood educators. Nevertheless, our top
priority remains being here to serve you anytime, even if it means doing so
with a little less than our usual polish. I'm proud of how nimbly our Ally
team has adapted, and grateful for your cooperation through the process.

*We're here to help.*
Like many of you, we also have family and friends who work in industries
that have been hit hard, and we're committed to playing a vital role in our
nation's recovery. We responded to the early days of this crisis with a
robust relief package in an effort to help our most affected customers stay
afloat financially, keep families in their homes, and give businesses a
lifeline to continue operating as best as can be. We'll continue to be here
to answer your questions and provide informative content to help demystify
financial conditions that even the experts are grappling with. As this
unprecedented situation continues to develop, we'll continue to respond to
it in ways that put you, our customers, first. We were not asked to take
these actions – we took these steps because that is what our brand stands
for – Doing it Right. Always. Knowing that we have already assisted many of
you brings affirmation to our approach and outreach. Our teams continue
talking about finding the good from this situation, and certainly our
engagement with you, our customers, has been inspiring.

*We'll come through this stronger, together.*
Speaking for all of us here at Ally, I extend our heartfelt thanks to all
of you who are essential workers and healthcare professionals, our deep
empathy and concern to those of you directly affected by the virus, and our
best wishes for the safety, good health and security of all our customers.

Each day, we're inspired by so many of you who are living up to our highest
ideals as citizens, as communities, and as a nation. You're an inspiration
to all of us here to continue, as your bank – and as your ally – to keep
living up to our name.

Stay healthy and safe. We will overcome by working together.
