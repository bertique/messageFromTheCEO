Keeping you safe and connected is our top concern


My Account >


To our customers,

I am writing to let you know what we are doing to ensure you remain
connected to your Xfinity services amid growing concerns about Coronavirus.
There's nothing more important to us than the safety and wellbeing of our
customers and teammates. But beyond that, we also know how important
reliable service is to you, now more than ever.

We continue to monitor guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
and other public health officials along with local market conditions. In
the meantime, we have taken the following steps:


•
*Maintaining Network Reliability:* We engineer our network for capacity to
handle spikes and shifts in usage patterns, and we continuously test,
monitor and enhance our systems and network to ensure they are ready to
support customer usage as needed. Our engineers and technicians will
continue to staff our network operations centers 24/7 to ensure network
performance and reliability.

•
*Keeping Stores Clean:* Providing safe and clean environments for our
customers is a top priority. We are committed to upholding the highest
standards of cleanliness in our retail stores. Our stores are
professionally cleaned every day using methods recommended by public health
authorities.

•
*Employee & In-Home Support:* Our supervisors are reinforcing public health
guidelines with every employee including technicians and retail store
associates. Please know that if employees are feeling unwell, they are not
to report to work. If at any time you want or need to reschedule a
technician home visit, we will be happy to do so.

•
*News and Information: *To help keep you informed, we have created a
collection of the most current news and information on Coronavirus. Just
say "coronavirus" into your X1 or Flex Voice Remote.

•
*Educational Content:* For those with school-age students at home, we've
created new educational collections for all grade levels in partnership
with Common Sense Media. Just say "education" into your X1 or Flex Voice
Remote.

We also want to remind you of our digital support tools, all of which you
can access right from your smartphone, in X1 or online. If you need support
with your service or devices, the following steps will help:


•
Visit Xfinity My Account

or download our apps

to manage your Xfinity services, troubleshoot issues and update your
contact information so we can keep you informed.
•
Say "Help" into your X1 or Flex Voice Remote for a guide on quick fixes and
support.
•
Contact us through chat in the Xfinity Assistant
.



Please know we remain committed to you and to all the people we serve. Our
teammates live and work in your local community; we are your neighbors. We
will continue our focus on delivering the services you depend on in a
manner consistent with the health and wellbeing of our customers and our
team.

Please stay safe and healthy,



Dave Watson
President & CEO
Comcast Cable
